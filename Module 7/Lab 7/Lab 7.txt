Lab 7

Please compelete 1 of the following 2 programming problems:



1. Create a function that checks a string of parentheses to see if it is "balanced". A balanced string of parentheses is one in which the parentheses are arranged correctly. For example:

()
(())
()()
(())()(()())

are all balanced strings of parentheses.

)(
((
(()(())

are not balanced strings of parentheses.


Your function should be called isBalanced, take a string as an argument, and return a boolean value - it should have the following prototype:

bool isBalanced(string paren);

Please make use of the string functions mentioned in chapter 7 of your book. I think that erase(), length(), find(), empty(), and a loop should be sufficient to solve the problem. Then, make a main function that obtains user input, tests it with the function, and outputs the result.


2. Create a function that takes an integer and returns the sum of the integer's digits. The function's prototype will be

int sumDigits(int n);

and, as an example, the call sumDigits(12345) should give the return value 15. Then, make a main function that obtains user input, tests it with the function, and outputs the result.
