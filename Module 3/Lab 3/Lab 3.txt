Lab 3

 1.       Create a program that calculates a future day of the week. Your program should input two items: the current day represented as a string (such as “Monday” or “Friday”), and an integer of how many days to count into the future. For example, Monday 7 would give the output Monday (since there are seven days in a week!) Wednesday 9 would give the output Friday, and Saturday 29 would give the output Sunday. Do not assume anything sneaky like leap years!

 2.       Create a program that computes the profits (or losses!) from selling stock. The program should input the number of shares owned, the purchase price of the shares, the selling price of the shares, and service charges due to the brokerage upon selling the stock. For example, if the user bought 10 shares of stock for $10 each and sold them for $15 each with a 1.5% brokerage fee applied to the total sale price, then they would have made $47.75.

 3.       Create a program that computes the product of two binomials. The program should take two binomials as input (in the form “ax+b” where a and b are integers and there are NO SPACES) and output a trinomial (in the form ax^2 + bx + c). For example, the inputs “2x+5” and “–4x+3” should give the output “–8x^2 – 14x + 15” WITH SPACES for legibility. Recall the FOIL formula… first, inside, outside, last!

 4.       Create a program that finds the roots of a trinomial. The program should input the coefficients of the trinomial assuming that they are only space separated (the easy way!) For example, the input “3 2 1” corresponds to the trinomial 3x^2 + 2x + 1. Now, you may recall that the number of roots of a trinomial is dependent upon the value of a formula called the DISCRIMINANT. The discriminant is the forumula b^2 – 4*a*c. If the discriminant is positive, there are two roots, if it is zero, there is one root, and if it is negative, there are no roots. Please use the discriminant to determine how many roots to print. Once that is finished, you have to actually print the roots. To compute these, please use the quadratic formula:

 

–b +- sqrt(b^2 – 4*a*c)

------------------------------

            2*a

 

For one last example, the input 1 3 2 is the trinomial x^2 + 3x + 2. Its discriminant is 1 (which is positive) so there will be two roots. The roots are -1 and -2, which can be found using the quadratic formula above. For your output, please print only the roots, however many of them there are. Good luck!
