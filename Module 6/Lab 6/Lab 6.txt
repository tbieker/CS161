Please do the following 3 problems:

1. Write a function that returns the number of vowels in a word. 
For example: vowels("fancy") would return 1.

2. Using the function that returns voweld, create a function that
returns the number of consonants in a word. 
For example: consonants("egotist") would return 4.

3. Using these two functions and the list of english words from
last week, find the percentage of vowels and percentage consonants 
in English. You should get a percentage of vowels = 37.4% and 
consonants = 62.5%.
