Lab 5

CS 161

For this lab, you will use a list of English words to find out interesting things about our language.
Please hard code the path of the file into your program and do not ask the user to input it - 
if you put it in the C drive, it would make my life easier. Mac/Linux people, don't worry about that.
Also, if you could put all of your responses into one file (clearly commented!), that would be easier
for both of us. This week, please do all three questions!

1. Find the largest word on the list, print it, and print it's length (the str.length() function will help here!).

2. Find all of the words with one letter and print them.

3. Find the number of words of every possible length and print how many there are in a table.
   The table should start off looking like this:

	Length	Number of Words
	1	2
	2	140
	.	.
	.	.
	.	.

   What is the commonest length of English word?
